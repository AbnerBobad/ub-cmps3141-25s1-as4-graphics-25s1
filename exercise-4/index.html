    <h2>Vector Graphics Editor Experience</h2>

    <section class="ex3-section">
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p><strong>Editor Used:</strong> Figma (second-time user)</p>
      <p><strong>Previous Experience:</strong> This is my second time using Figma. While I have some basic familiarity with the interface, I still do not fully understand what all the different features and tools do.</p>
      <p><strong>Time Spent:</strong> Approximately 2-3 hours to complete the business card design and explore the tools.</p>

      <h3>Pain Points and Struggles</h3>
      <ol class="writeup-list">
        <li><strong>Finding the right tools:</strong> The toolbar icons were not immediately obvious. I had to hover over each one to understand their purpose. The shortcut keys (like R for rectangle, T for text) helped once I discovered them.</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding frames vs groups:</strong> I was confused about when to use frames versus groups. I had to Google the difference and learned that frames are better for layout containers.</li>
        <li><strong>Importing custom fonts:</strong> Installing the Museo font required downloading the Figma desktop app. This was not obvious from the web interface.</li>
        <li><strong>Exporting as SVG:</strong> Finding the export options took some time. I initially looked in the File menu but later found it in the right sidebar under Design.</li>
        <li><strong>Converting text to outlines:</strong> This was tricky to find. I had to Google how to "flatten" text in Figma and learned about the "Outline Stroke" and "Flatten" commands.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="ex3-section">
      <h3>What I Had to Google</h3>
      <ul class="writeup-list">
        <li>How to import SVG in Figma</li>
        <li>Difference between frames and groups in Figma</li>
        <li>How to install custom fonts in Figma</li>
        <li>How to convert text to outlines in Figma</li>
        <li>How to export as SVG in Figma</li>
        <li>How to set exact dimensions for shapes</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="ex3-section">
      <h3>Learnability Assessment</h3>
      <p><strong>Could the app have been more learnable?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes, I believe Figma could improve learnability in several ways:</p>
      <ul class="writeup-list">
        <li><strong>Better onboarding:</strong> A quick interactive tutorial for first-time users would help introduce the basic concepts like frames, layers, and the component system.</li>
        <li><strong>Clearer tool labels:</strong> Having text labels alongside icons (or as a toggle option) would make the toolbar more discoverable.</li>
        <li><strong>Contextual help:</strong> Showing hints when hovering over panels would explain what each section does.</li>
        <li><strong>Search in properties:</strong> A search function in the right sidebar would help find specific settings faster.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>However, Figma does have good documentation online, and the community tutorials were very helpful. Once I learned the basics, the interface became more intuitive.</p>

      <h3>Positive Aspects</h3>
      <ul class="writeup-list">
        <li>The auto-save feature prevented any loss of work</li>
        <li>Real-time collaboration features are impressive</li>
        <li>The zoom and pan controls are smooth and responsive</li>
        <li>Smart guides for alignment made precise positioning easy</li>
        <li>The color picker and gradient tools were intuitive</li>
